Starting with the second season, the title was shortened to \"NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service\".  The producers of the series felt that having the name \"Navy\" in the title would be redundant, as the title would then be \"Navy Naval Criminal Investigative Service\".\nThe premise and characters of \"Navy NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service\" was first introduced in two one hour episodes on the hit television series \"JAG\" (1995).\nIn the \"JAG\" episodes \"Ice Queen\" and \"Meltdown\", NCIS was brought in to investigate the murder of JAG Officer Lt. Loren Singer.\nThe two \"JAG\" episodes were later edited into a single hour long episode, and  broadcast as the pilot for the new series under the name \"Navy NCIS: The Beginning\".  That episode aired on October 21, 2003, nearly a month after the first episode of the series \"Yankee White\" was aired on September 23, 2003."

Bellisario served in the US Marines during the 1950s before becoming an advertising writer and executive in the 1960s. In the 1970s, Bellisario moved to Los Angeles to pursue a desire to write and produce television shows. Bellisario worked with senior producer Glen Larson and together they created the highly rated Tom Selleck vehicle \"Magnum P.I.\". \n\nBellisario developed the successful \"JAG\" program about Navy and Marine lawyers. \"JAG\" ran from 1995-2005. \"NCIS\" was a spin-off from \"JAG\", introduced during a two-part arc in season eight. Bellisario is also the step-father of \"NCIS\" co-star Sean Murray (Tim McGee) having married Murray's mother Vivienne in 1998. Chances are you have watched a movie or television show created by the men in the incorrect answers. Anthony Zuiker created \"CSI\", Dick Wolfe \"Law & Order\" and Jerry Bruckheimer is the producer of countless hit movies, including the \"Beverly Hills Cop\" and \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" franchises."
